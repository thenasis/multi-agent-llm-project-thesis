Please solve this math problem step by step: For what negative value of $k$ is there exactly one solution to the system of equations \begin{aligned}
y &= 2x^2 + kx + 6 \\
y &= -x + 4
\end{aligned}

Math_Assistant (to user_proxy):

To find the negative value of $k$ for which there is exactly one solution to the system of equations, we need to consider the discriminant of the quadratic equation obtained by setting the two equations equal to each other.

First, set $2x^2 + kx + 6 = -x + 4$:
\[2x^2 + (k+1)x + 2 = 0\]

The discriminant of this quadratic equation is given by $D = (k+1)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = k^2 + 2k + 1 - 16 = k^2 + 2k - 15$.

For the equation to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be equal to zero: $k^2 + 2k - 15 = 0$.

Now, let's solve this quadratic equation for $k$:
\[k^2 + 2k - 15 = 0\]

We can factor this quadratic equation as:
\[(k+5)(k-3) = 0\]

Setting each factor to zero gives us two possible values for $k$:
\[k+5 = 0 \Rightarrow k = -5\]
\[k-3 = 0 \Rightarrow k = 3\]

So, the negative value of $k$ for which there is exactly one solution to the system of equations is $k = \boxed{-5}$.
